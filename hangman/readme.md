## General Information
- The computer draws a word from the list entered in the program, writes it in the form of dashes (-) as many letters in the word, as many dashes. 
- Then the player guesses what the word is by giving letters at random. 
- If the letter given by him is in a given word, we write it on the appropriate line. 
- The player has 10 chances and 6 stages of Hangman to guess the letters/word. If the player guesses the wrong letter, a hangman is drawn.
- The player has a chance to guess the word by typing the whole word instead of a letter.
- The player does not have to pay attention to the capitalization of the typed letters.
